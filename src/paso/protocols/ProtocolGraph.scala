/** represents a "cycle" (the period between two state transitions) of the protocol:
 * - all assertions over the outputs in this cycle are encoded as boolean formulas with the input constraints as guards
 *   like: `in := 1 ; assert(out == 2)` gets encoded as `(in = 1) => (out = 2)`
 * - the final input assumptions, i.e. the stable input signals that will determine the next state are also
 *   encoded separately as guarded assumptions. The guard in this case is the path condition.
 *   ```
 *   in := 1
 *   when c:
 *     in := 2
 *   ```
 *   results in: `(c => (in = 2)) and (not(c) => (in = 1))`
 *   it might be better to encode this as `in = ite(c, 2, 1)` ...
 * - final input assumptions depend on the same path guards as the next cycle
 * - there could be different next cycles depending on ret/arg or module i/o, these are encoded as a priority list
 *   with guards that need to be evaluated from front to back, the first guard which is true is the transition that
 *   should be taken
 * - TODO: encode mapping of method args (the first time args are applied to the inputs, they are treated as a mapping,
 *         after that they are a constraint)
